System Requirements
-------

You need **PHP >= 5.5.0** to use `JSend` but the latest stable version of PHP/HHVM is recommended.

Install
-------

Install `JSend` using Composer.

```
$ composer require carpediem/jsend
```

Going solo
-------

You can also use the library without Composer by:

* heading to the [releases page](https://github.com/carpediem/JSend/releases)
* selecting your version and downloading it in your preferred format

Once extracted you will be able to load the library using any [PSR-4][] compatible autoloader.
